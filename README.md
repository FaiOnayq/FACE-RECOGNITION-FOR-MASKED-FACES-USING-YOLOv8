# FACE-RECOGNITION-FOR-MASKED-FACES-USING-YOLOv8
A deep learning-based computer vision project that uses YOLOv8 to detect face masks in images and videos. The model identifies three classes: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect. Built for real-time applications in public safety and lab access control.
